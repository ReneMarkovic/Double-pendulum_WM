# Project: Modeling and Solving the Dynamics of a Double Pendulum in Wolfram Mathematica

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to model the dynamics of a **double pendulum** in **Wolfram Mathematica** and understand the underlying physics. You will start with the basic concepts of a single pendulum, learn how to solve it, and then transition to the more complex double pendulum. The final report should demonstrate your understanding of these concepts and your ability to model and analyze them.

## Introduction:
A pendulum is a weight suspended from a pivot that can swing freely. It demonstrates simple harmonic motion when its displacement is small, and its behavior can be predicted with basic physics equations. Double pendulums consist of two pendulums connected end-to-end, creating a more complex system with chaotic behavior.

## Task Outline:

### Explanation of a Single Pendulum:
Describe what a pendulum is.
- Explain the basic physics behind a single pendulum.
- Present the differential equations that govern the motion of a simple pendulum.
- Discuss solutions to the single pendulum, focusing on small-angle approximations and the role of gravity.

### Solving a Single Pendulum in Wolfram Mathematica:
- Write a code snippet to simulate the motion of a single pendulum.
- Include graphical visualizations, such as plots of displacement over time or phase space diagrams.
- Analyze the output, noting any key observations about the pendulum's motion.

### Introduction to the Double Pendulum:
- Define the double pendulum and describe how it differs from a single pendulum.
- Explain why the double pendulum is known for its chaotic behavior.
- Discuss the significance of initial conditions and how they can lead to vastly different outcomes.

### Solving a Double Pendulum in Wolfram Mathematica:
- Present the differential equations for a double pendulum.
- Write a Mathematica code snippet to simulate the double pendulum's motion.
- Include graphical visualizations, such as plots of the pendulum's trajectory or phase space diagrams.
- Analyze the output, discussing any evidence of chaos or unpredictable behavior.
- Highlight the sensitivity to initial conditions and its impact on the double pendulum's dynamics.

### Conclusion:
- Summarize the key learnings from the project.
- Discuss the significance of double pendulums in physics and their applications.
- Reflect on any challenges faced during the project and how they were overcome.
